	<h2>About Me:</h2>
	<p>I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. I made aliyah in 2011 and then joined the Israeli army in the combat
		engineering corps. After my required service, I worked as a cook in various restaurants in Tel-Aviv for about five years.</p>
	<p>In November 2019, I enrolled into the Developerâ€™s Institute bootcamp for web development in Python. The bootcamp
		was comprehensive starting with an intro into web-development with HTML, CSS and Javascript, including using Bootstrap 4.
		After that the course went into programming with Python3, including OOP and Function based programming. Next we learned
		the basics of database systems using PostgreSQL.  At the end of the bootcamp we took all we learned and wrapped
		it together by working on the web frameworks Flask and Django. The final project was to create a unique website using all we have learned.
	</p>
	<p>
			After the boot camp I focused on learning more web development, attending many meet-ups in the Tel-Aviv area, and teaching myself deployment for Django using Linode, Nginx, and Gunicorn.
	</p>
	<p>
			I am currently working as an intern for Togedoor(togedoor.com) an online marketplace created using Wix.
